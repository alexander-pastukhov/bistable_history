    "description": "A package to compute a cumulative history for time-series of perceptual dominance in bistable displays.</p><p>Estimates cumulative history, an estimate of accumulating adaptation/prediction error for the dominant percept, for time-series for continuously viewed bistable perceptual rivalry displays. Computes cumulative history via a homogeneous first order differential process. I.e., it assumes exponential growth/decay of the history as a function of time and perceptually dominant state. Supports Gamma, log normal, and normal distribution families.",
